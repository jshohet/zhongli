  "Are you a Geo construct? Because my heart becomes resonant whenever I'm with you.",

  "Are you hydro-elemental? Because every time I look at you, I feel like I'm falling in love with you, all over again. Truly, an elegy for the end, wouldn't you say?",

"Are you a treasure hoarder? Because my heart is the bounty that you've plundered.",

"Hmm, could it be that you're a Vision? Because a world without you would be void of color.",

"Are you a Ley Line? For I feel a strong attraction pulling me towards you every passing moment.",

"Are you made of Electro Crystal? Because I'm getting shocked by your electric personality.",

"Are you a Starfell Sword? Because you've definitely fallen from the stars and straight into my heart.",

"Do you resonate with Geo? Because just like the steadfast stone, my affection for you remains permanent and unyielding.",

"Are you an Adeptus? Because since I've met you, my time seems to flow differently. Each moment is both transient like a ripple, and enduring like a geode."
